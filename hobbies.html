												<h3>Swimming</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Swimming is my jam, and I get in the water about 3-4 times a week. 
												I've got the hang of all four strokes - freestyle, backstroke, butterfly, and breaststroke. 
												It's not about competition; it's my way of staying active and having a good time. 
												The pool's my happy place where I can just unwind and enjoy the water.</p>

												<h3>Drawing</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Drawing is my thing, especially when it comes to creating whimsical cartoon characters.
												 During the pandemic, I took my love for cartoons to the next level by transforming my home into a colorful canvas. 
												 Yep, you heard it right – I painted all the walls with some of my favorite cartoon characters. 
												 It was a creative journey that turned my living space into a fun and vibrant world. 
												 Drawing, whether on walls or paper, is my creative escape, my way of adding a little splash of joy to life. 
												 If you ever drop by my house in India, you'll see my walls are a testament to my love for all things cartoonish! </p>

												<h3>Cooking</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Cooking has been my go-to hobby, and it all started during those lockdown days. 
												I decided to embark on a culinary adventure, cooking up a storm with different breakfasts every day. 
												It was my way of adding some excitement to those challenging times. 
												Fast forward to today, here in San Francisco, and guess what? 
												My passion for cooking is still sizzling hot! 
												I find myself in the kitchen every day, whipping up delightful dishes that reflect the vibrant food scene of this amazing city. 
												So, if you ever swing by, you're in for a treat with a taste of my lockdown-inspired breakfasts and San Francisco-inspired creations! </p>

												<h3>Reading</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Reading novels is another one of my passions, and I have a soft spot for insightful books like "Zero to One" and "The Power of the Unconscious Mind." 
												These reads offer a treasure trove of knowledge and inspiration. 
												Currently, I've delved into a book I snagged at a college fest, titled "The Inclusive Organization." 
												It's an intriguing journey into the world of fostering inclusivity and diversity in the workplace. 
												Reading books like these is not just a hobby but a way for me to expand my horizons and gain fresh perspectives. </p>

												<h3>Exploring new Places</h3>
											</header>
											<p>While I haven't been to every nook and cranny of India (I'm still eyeing Eastern India for my next adventure), 
												I've made it a point to travel extensively and experience the rich diversity of this incredible country. 
													And here's the kicker: when I had the chance to fly directly to San Francisco, I opted for a 10 hrs layover in Los Angeles on the 4th of July! 
													Why? Because I like exploring new cities, and what better way to celebrate Independence Day than by immersing myself in the vibrant culture of LA. 
													It's all about seizing opportunities to discover new places and create unforgettable memories! </p>

											</header>
											<p>I do know how to let loose and have a blast when the occasion calls for it. 
												Take New Year's, for instance; that's my ultimate party night! 
												I make it a point to welcome the coming year in style, whether that means hitting the town with friends or discovering a new place to dance and celebrate. </p>

											</header>
											<p>Yep! I like sleeping. It's my ultimate pleasure.
												It's like a super-secret club where my bed's the VIP lounge, and my dreams are the headliners. 
												It's the only hobby where I can excel by just closing my eyes and lying down – no medals needed! 
												I believe who needs a passport when you've got a pillow? 
												So there you have it, folks, my not-so-secret hobby that I've truly perfected – the art of snoozing!</p>
